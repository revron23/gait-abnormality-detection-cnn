# Gait Abnormality Detection using CNN

This repository contains an academic research project focused on detecting gait abnormalities using machine learning and deep learning techniques based on Ground Reaction Force (GRF) data.

## Project Overview
Gait abnormalities are important indicators of underlying health conditions. This project explores multiple machine learning models and a proposed multi-layered Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify normal and abnormal gait patterns.

## Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Proposed Multi-layered CNN

## Key Results
- CNN achieved the highest accuracy of approximately **95.57%**
- Evaluation performed using **5-fold cross-validation**
- CNN outperformed traditional ML models in accuracy and generalization

## My Contribution
- Model training and experimentation
- Performance evaluation and comparison
- Team coordination during research and experimentation phase

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Repository Contents
- Research paper
- Model architecture and results
- Experimental analysis
